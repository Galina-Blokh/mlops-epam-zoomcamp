# mlops-epam-zoomcamp


1. **Machine Learning in Production - Module 0: Theory baseline**
   
   *In this module, you will identify the various components and design an ML production system end-to-end: project scoping, data needs, modelling strategies, and deployment constraints and requirements; and learn how to establish a model baseline, address concept drift, and prototype the process for developing, deploying, and continuously improving a productionized ML application*.

2. **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 1: Introduction**

   *Tech: Docker, AWS*
   <br>*Focus: Module 1 is dedicated to setting up the key tools and technologies youâ€™ll be using throughout the course and introducing you to the concept of MLOps and why we need to use that concept.*

3. **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 2: Experiment tracking**

   *Tech: MLFlow*
<br>*Focus: Module 2 covers experiment tracking to store and organize relevant information about your experiments. For example, the input data, source code, model architecture parameters, and corresponding outputs of the model.*

4 **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 3: Orchestration and ML Pipelines**

*Tech: Mage*
<br> *Focus: Module 3 focuses on creating a production-ready pipeline for training machine learning models. It means that the pipeline is easily reproduced, and re-run, in a fully automated way.*

5. **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 4: Model Deployment

   *Tech: Flask, Docker, MLflow, Mage, AWS Lambda & AWS Kinesis*
   <br> *Focus: Module 4 introduces you to the three ways of model deployment and gives you a demonstration of how to work with each of them.*

6. **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 5: Model Monitoring**
   *Tech: Prometheus, Evidently AI, and Grafana*
   <br> *Focus: Module 5 is about monitoring machine learning models including service health, model performance, data quality and integrity, and data Drift & concept drift.*

7. **MLOps Zoomcamp - Module 6: Best Practices**
   *Tech: Python, Docker, Localstack, Github Actions*
   <br> *Focus: Module 6 summarizes the best practices like unit tests, integration tests, checking code quality, and automating deployments with CI/CD and GitHub Actions.*
